### 2.6 Blinking an LED ###

The file hello.pru0.c will blink the USR3 LED, and the file led.pru0.c will blink a GPIO LED. The file speed.pru0.c toggles the GPIO as fast as possible to measure the maximum
frequency, which I measured at 12.5 MHz. The signal at this speed was not very stable and was not very square.

### 5.3 PWM Generator ###

The file pwm.pru0.c generates a pwm signal through the PRU GPIO. The std_dev at 50MHz was 70kHz, and the waveform was not at all square. The waveform was fairly stable however.

### 5.4 Controlling the PWM Frequency ###

The PRU code for this section is in pwm4.pru0.c, and the ARM code is in pwm_test.c or the binary pwm_test. This code uses bits 0-3 which corresponds to pins 31, 29, 30 and 28. The highest frequency I was able to record was 630kHz, and the waveform looked pretty good at that frequency. The ARM code was able to dynamically change the PWM wave generated by the PRU.

### 5.9 Reading an Input at Regular Intervals ###

The file button.pru0.c turns on a GPIO LED when a button is pressed. The measured response time of this is ____.

### 5.10 Analog Wave Generator ###

The file sin.pru0.c creates the waveform generation. Along with the low pass filter, ...
