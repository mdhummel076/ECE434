### Logging in Sheets ###

tempRecorder.py records temperature and time data to [this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/127y9DWKHe3eSOpOxnTjSoLlpLfjw0FNWWMp3PAIquYs/edit?usp=sharing) spreadsheet.
The plot of the data is also in the spreadsheet. The files credentials.json and token.pickle are both credentials files to allow access to the spreadsheet from the bone.
